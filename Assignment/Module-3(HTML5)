==> < figure >	It defines a self-contained content, and referenced as a single unit.
==> < footer >	It represents the footer section of the webpage.

2.) How to embed audio and video in a webpage? 
==> Create a new HTML file in the same directory, called index. html . Add < audio > and < video > elements to the page; make them display the default browser controls. Give both of them < source > elements so that browsers will find the audio format they support best and load it.

3.) Semantic element in HTML5?
==> A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer.
==> Examples of non-semantic elements: < div > and < span > - Tells nothing about its content.
==> Examples of semantic elements: < form >, < table >, and < article > - Clearly defines its content.

4.) Canvas and SVG tags?
==> The Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) is an XML-based image format that is used to define two-dimensional vector-based graphics for the web. Unlike raster image (Ex .jpg, .gif, .png, etc.), a vector image can be scaled up or down to any extent without losing the image quality.
